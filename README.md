# Hand Detection

A simple implementation of heatmap regression for hand detection. We won't release pre-precessing and post-precessing code now. Free to prepare your own datasets. Again, it is just a alpha version, used only for validation.

# Testing
```bash
python test.py 
```

We provide a few test pictures and results. You can replace with your own test images.
