# Hand Detection

A simple implementation of heatmap regression for hand detection. We won't release pre-precessing and post-precessing code now. Free to prepare your own datasets. Again, it is just an alpha version, used only for validation. Try to play with it.

# Testing
```bash
python test.py 
```

We provide a few test pictures and results. You can replace with your own test images.

I also give out a few hand pics of myself, taking by phone without any adjustment. Remember, it only outputs a corase prediction, more precise methods will not provided here.
